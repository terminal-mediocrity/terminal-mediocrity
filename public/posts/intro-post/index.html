			<blockquote>
<p><strong>Who I am</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In relation to the title of this blog, I believe I am someone who is often attempting to escape terminal mediocrity. I believe that we all experience growth at different rates, but we eventually hit a state of terminal mediocrity where it feels that the acceleration of growth has stagnated, and we reach a state where we struggle to escape a mundane cycle of being that often times feels suffocating.</p>
<p>The velocity at which an object stays at when at terminal velocity is called &ldquo;settling velocity&rdquo;. The sound of &ldquo;settling&rdquo; often is quite difficult to accept and something I fear. Despite doing somewhat well in school, I have often been described by close friends and managers as being &ldquo;scatter-brained&rdquo; and &ldquo;super disorganized&rdquo; with my thoughts and ideas. I do not disagree with any of these descriptions and hope to improve on my organization + presentation skills of my thoughts through this blog.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I have a very bad habit of bringing up stories + ideas with thinking them fully through. Often times, I find that in conversations in person, I bring up long-winded stories + half-baked thoughts without a meaningful punchline.</p>
<p>Aside from these points, I&rsquo;m a pretty free-spirited adventurer, lurker, romantic, film lover, Christian&hellip;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Purpose of this Blog</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Partly inspired by: <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/read.html">Paul Graham&rsquo;s Post on Reading + Writing</a>  (I&rsquo;m somewhat of a PG fanboy)</p>
<p>Given that I dislike fast-paced SNS and want to spend time presenting complicated ideas, I felt that blogging was probably the best option to turn to.</p>
<p><em>Some of the objectives I hope to achieve from this blog (no particular order):</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Share ideas that spark discourse and further thought</li>
<li>Hone + push half-baked thoughts</li>
<li>Recommend cool + interesting things and why I find them cool + interesting</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Main contents I hope you will enjoy reading:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Love Portrayed</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t say I&rsquo;m a hopeless romantic, but I&rsquo;d argue that I find the ways individuals portray love to each other to be very interesting. Whether its a scene in a movie, a chapter in a book, lyrics in a song, or an anecdote from a couple, I hope to share each of these moments and create a collection of lovely moments :).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Food Diary</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>I like to keep track of everything I eat to track my calories. This section will be composed of everything I consume with my 5 senses. It&rsquo;ll often feature my very opinionated 2 cents. Given it&rsquo;s only 2 cents, take the recommendations/disapprovals with a pinch of salt&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Good BYBs</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Like most Gen-Z folks out there, I research the heck out of everything I plan on purchasing. However, there is a huge difference between being a seasoned consumer of a product category vs. a newbie buying something for the first time. These are dynamic lists that change based on my initial research + experience using a product/service over time. I hope you find these useful.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Jesus On My Necklace</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>As someone who struggles with their faith on a daily basis, I find that discussion of sermons are a great way to check in on my faith as well as share what Christians listen to on a weekly basis. You are welcome to completely disregard this part of my blog if it does not interest you!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dabbles and Babbles</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of people will say I look like someone who does art. I don&rsquo;t, but I try. I&rsquo;ve been self-learning music composition + sketching. Hope your eyes and ears don&rsquo;t bleed&hellip;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AMA</strong></li>
