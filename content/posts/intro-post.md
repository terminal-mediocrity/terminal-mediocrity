> **Who I am** 

In relation to the title of this blog, I believe I am someone who is often attempting to escape terminal mediocrity. I believe that we all experience growth at different rates, but we eventually hit a state of terminal mediocrity where it feels that the acceleration of growth has stagnated, and we reach a state where we struggle to escape a mundane cycle of being that often times feels suffocating. 

The velocity at which an object stays at when at terminal velocity is called "settling velocity". The sound of "settling" often is quite difficult to accept and something I fear. Despite doing somewhat well in school, I have often been described by close friends and managers as being "scatter-brained" and "super disorganized" with my thoughts and ideas. I do not disagree with any of these descriptions and hope to improve on my organization + presentation skills of my thoughts through this blog. 

Furthermore, I have a very bad habit of bringing up stories + ideas with thinking them fully through. Often times, I find that in conversations in person, I bring up long-winded stories + half-baked thoughts without a meaningful punchline.

Aside from these points, I'm a pretty free-spirited adventurer, lurker, romantic, film lover, Christian...

> **Purpose of this Blog**

Partly inspired by: [Paul Graham's Post on Reading + Writing](http://www.paulgraham.com/read.html)  (I'm somewhat of a PG fanboy)

Given that I dislike fast-paced SNS and want to spend time presenting complicated ideas, I felt that blogging was probably the best option to turn to. 

*Some of the objectives I hope to achieve from this blog (no particular order):*
- Share ideas that spark discourse and further thought
- Hone + push half-baked thoughts
- Recommend cool + interesting things and why I find them cool + interesting

*Main contents I hope you will enjoy reading:*
- **Love Portrayed**

I wouldn't say I'm a hopeless romantic, but I'd argue that I find the ways individuals portray love to each other to be very interesting. Whether its a scene in a movie, a chapter in a book, lyrics in a song, or an anecdote from a couple, I hope to share each of these moments and create a collection of lovely moments :).

- **Food Diary**

I like to keep track of everything I eat to track my calories. This section will be composed of everything I consume with my 5 senses. It'll often feature my very opinionated 2 cents. Given it's only 2 cents, take the recommendations/disapprovals with a pinch of salt...

- **Good BYBs**

Like most Gen-Z folks out there, I research the heck out of everything I plan on purchasing. However, there is a huge difference between being a seasoned consumer of a product category vs. a newbie buying something for the first time. These are dynamic lists that change based on my initial research + experience using a product/service over time. I hope you find these useful. 

- **Jesus On My Necklace**

As someone who struggles with their faith on a daily basis, I find that discussion of sermons are a great way to check in on my faith as well as share what Christians listen to on a weekly basis. You are welcome to completely disregard this part of my blog if it does not interest you!

- **Dabbles and Babbles**

A lot of people will say I look like someone who does art. I don't, but I try. I've been self-learning music composition + sketching. Hope your eyes and ears don't bleed...

- **AMA**
